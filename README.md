# RC-car

The project was completed as part of Mechatronics course curriculum at University of Pennsylvania. It is a RC Car constructed from scratch using ESP32 micro-controllers which communicated through WiFi. It achieved the fastest lap-time in solo queue which was possible through sound implementation of mechanical design, electrical design and software stack. 

# Team-mates
